# RuiFlex examples

Build and run examples with "doit". Generated files are in the
subdirectories.

"normal" generates a "global" lexer, with default options.

"reentrant" generates a reentrant lexer, which is thread safe. RuiFlex
control file includes some more sophisticated controls for Flex.

Cleaning can be explicitly performed with "clean" command.
